        <li> A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings – sort of like camouflage. However, this isn’t true.<br></li>
        <li> Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment. <br></li>
        <li> Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body. Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones, and can bend round to grab their pray. <br></li>
        <li> Chameleons take a while to hatch, and don’t live very long. These eggs can take anywhere between 4 and 12 months to hatch. <br></li>
        <li> Generally, chameleons don’t live very long – some for up to 10 years in captivity, with some dying after as few as 2.  <br></li>
